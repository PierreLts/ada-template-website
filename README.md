# Stars or Storyline: How Actor Fame and Sentiment Trajectories Shape a Movie's Critical Success

## Introduction

In the world of cinema, understanding what makes a movie successful is complex and multi-faceted. Does the star power of its cast drive success, or does a captivating storyline influence audience perception more significantly? Our project seeks to unravel these elements, focusing on how both actor fame and the emotional journey of the plot contribute to a movie's critical success.

### Project Overview
