## Success Metric Definition

We developed a comprehensive success metric that combines both quality (ratings) and popularity (vote count):

```
Success = Rating Ã— log(Number of Votes)
```

This formula balances:
- Movie quality (through ratings)
- Audience reach (through vote count)
- Scale effects (through logarithmic transformation)
